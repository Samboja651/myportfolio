            <p style="text-align: center; padding: 0 10%;">
                I'm interested in cybersecurity because when AI replaces developers, I'll be the one hacking it, breaking it and creating work for developers and myself. <br>
                I'm interested in cloud computing, the idea that I can create super powerful vitual computers that run in the cloud, fires me up. <br>
                I'm interested in backend development because I love learning the logic of how things work.
