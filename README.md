## Portfolio Development Challenges
**1. Making a portfolio responsive on different screen sizes**\
`solution`\
I watched **youtube tutorials** and learnt how to use **media queries**.\
I used **chrome developer tools** to adjust **screen sizes**. \
Whenever my page **broke out of shape** I used that **breakpoint** for the **media queries**.

**2. Design Challenge**\
I drew a sketch of my portfolio on paper.\
Transforming that sketch into a webpage was a big hustle.\
`solution`\
I digged deeper into **html semantic elements**. \
I noticed that using the right elements greatly improves the **webpage layout** and **simplifies the styling**. \
**In my layout I used** elements like `header, main, footer, section, nav, details & summary` and this gave a better skeleton of my webpage.
